In this tutorial, I have implemented a simple real-life example of most popular design patttern, **MVVM**.

I kept the source code simple, just to show you the MVVM design pattern! This app will call a simple GET api from [The Movie Database - TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/ "The Movie Database - TMDb") and shows the popular moivies posters and names in a gridview.

**Remember : **You have to create a new API key for your own, its free to test.

Watch [this video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scJy6gA230s "this video ")to obtain your own api_key.
